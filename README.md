JSProjects — JavaScript Mini Projects

A collection of JavaScript Mini projects built to practice DOM manipulation, UI components, and real-world logic.
Inspired by "GreatStack – 30 Days, 30 JavaScript Projects."

This repository will include 30+ mini JavaScript projects, updated daily as part of my re-study and skill-building phase.
